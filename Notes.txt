Variable descriptions

Intake:
    Animal ID 
      - probably not useful aside from maybe matching with the outcomes data. 
    Name 
      - sensitive information + not very useful - probably best to drop completely
    DateTime
      - Not sure if this is an intake date or a logging date? I don't really need this level of specificity unless I want to see correlation of 
        intake with day of the week or similar. 
    MonthYear
      - could be useful for monitoring trends over time or potentially seeing if there is fluctuation in intake/placement based on month 
    Found Location 
      - probably not useful beyond maybe identifying areas that have a lot of strays/drop-offs
      - a ton of different locations, potentially sensitive information somehow?
    Intake Type
      - 'Stray', 'Public Assist', 'Owner Surrender', 'Wildlife', Abandoned', 'Euthanasia Request'
    Intake Condition 
       - interested for correlate between placement & possible illnesses - consider clustering to manage dummies
       - 'Normal', 'Injured', 'Pregnant', 'Sick', 'Nursing', 'Aged',  'Unknown', 'Congenital', 'Medical', 'Other', 'Neonatal',
       'Med Attn', 'Feral', 'Behavior', 'Med Urgent', 'Space', 'Agonal', 'Neurologic', 'Panleuk', 'Parvo'
       - Possible Clusters: Normal; Nursing/Pregnant/Neonate; Aged; Injured; Unwell (Sick, Congenital, Medical, Med Attn, Parvo); 
        Severely Unwell (Med Urgent, Agonal, Neurologic, Panleuk); Behavioral, Feral, Other/Unknown/Space
            - the decision to put parvo in "unwell" instead of "severely unwell" is dependent on the shelter's success rate in managing them, but the survival
                rate it pretty good (80+%) with modern treatment. Conversely, panleuk's survival rate is still <50%. 
            - the decision to put neurologic in the severely unwell cluster is subjective as "neuro" is often severe/life-threatening but can be 
                mild/static long-term
            - the decision to leave "injured" as its own category is two-fold: 1) bc injuries can often heal w/o lasting consequence whereas other "unwell" 
                categories may have long-term consequences, and 2) injured has nearly 10000 pets included, so it's reasonable to think they might overwhelm
                another cluster's other cases (reducing the information attainable from those other cases). Arguable 2) also applies to the generic "sick" 
                value (7000+ pets), but I have no further information with which to separate these pets from "Med Attn", "Medical", etc.
    Animal 
      - 'Dog', 'Cat', 'Other', 'Bird', 'Livestock'
      - Probably limit assessments to dog & cat +/- birds given vagueness of other variable types
    Sex upon Intake
      - higher rates of intake of intact vs neutered animals?
      - Neutered Male', 'Spayed Female', 'Intact Male', 'Intact Female',  'Unknown'
    Age upon Intake 
      - when are the peak ages when an animal is taken in? Older for animals given up vs younger for stray?
      - How are there negative numbers????
    Breed
      - may impact placement or outcome
      - tons of different breeds; probably not accurate
    Color - probably not that useful, but maybe investigate the "black dog effect"
      - tons of different colors; probably not accurate
      - could maybe investigate "easy ones" like merle, calico, brindle, etc.

Outcome
    Animal ID 
      - probably not useful aside from maybe matching with the outcomes data. 
    Name 
      - sensitive information + not very useful - probably best to drop completely
    DateTime
      - strongly suspect this is date of outcome (based on correlation between date of birth and age of outcome matching datetime)
      - parse to drop hours/minutes/seconds
      - useful to monitor trends over time/fluctations based on months/years
      - technically redundant with "age of outcome" - keeping both for now, but may only want to use one as ML input
    MonthYear 
      - redundant w/ date time - drop
    Date of Birth 
      - probably not accurate, but potentially impacts outcome
      - redundant/collinear w/ Age upon outcome?
    Outcome Type
      - Rto-Adopt', 'Adoption', 'Euthanasia', 'Transfer', 'Return to Owner', 'Died', 'Disposal', 'Missing', 'Relocate',
       'Stolen', 'Lost'
    Outcome Subtype
      - 'Partner', 'Foster', 'SCRP', 'Out State', 'Suffering', 'Underage', 'Snr', 'Rabies Risk', 'In Kennel', 'Offsite',
       'Aggressive', 'Enroute', 'Emergency', 'Field', 'At Vet', 'In Foster', 'Behavior', 'Medical', 'Possible Theft', 'Barn',
       'Customer S', 'Court/Investigation', 'In State', 'Emer', 'In Surgery', 'Prc'
      - Consistent pairings
            - Transfer: Partner, SCRP, Out State, Snr, In State, Emer
            - Adoption: Adoption, Offsite, Aggressive
            - Euthanasia: Suffering, Underage (almost always exotics), Rabies Risk (usually exotics), Behavior, Medical, 
                Court/Investigation
            - Died: Enroute (one single pairing w/ "missing"), Emergency, In Surgery 
            - Return to Owner: Field, Customer S, Prc
            - Missing: Possible Theft
            - "In Kennel" subtype is usually "Died" but sometimes "missing"
            - "At Vet" is Euthanasia OR Died
            - "In Foster" is Missing or Died
            - "Barn" transfer or adoption (relatively uncommon)
      - SCRP is probably Special Consideration Rescue Program
            - used for transferring animals, particularly cats, to specific rescue groups or foster care. 
            - typically aimed at providing additional care and support for animals with special needs or those who might not easily
              find homes through the shelter's regular adoption process.
      - Customer S - may indicate screening or investigation that occured prior to return to owner?
      - Prc - may indicate Post-Return Check or Pre-Return Consultation?
    Animal Type
      - 'Cat', 'Dog', 'Other', 'Bird', 'Livestock'
      - matches "Animal" from intake data
      - 'Other' always has more detail in "Breed" (ex. Other Animal -> Bat Breed)
    Sex upon Outcome
      - Neutered Male', 'Unknown', 'Intact Male', 'Spayed Female', 'Intact Female'
    Age upon Outcome
      - technically redundant with "age of outcome" - keeping both for now, but may only want to use one as ML input
    Breed
    Color

# Potential uses of data 
- what makes an animal more likely to be given up? what makes an animal more likely to be adopted
- what factors are associated with intake condition, intake type, and is there a "busy season"
- compare historic vs more recent data
- lost to follow up animals - can I find them on the intake data and see what's up?
- evaluate benefit to the state via Animal Type other, Rabies Risk, court investigation, disposal, euthansia + Underage 
    +/- spay/neuter? (to validate funding)
- assess progress on No Kill Plan (Feb 2011, ACC had a 92% live animal outcome rate)
    - I wonder if the transfer rates have increased as the kill rate has decreased
    - no obvious update on their website since 2011 on this initiative
- assess duration of stay for pets who get adopted - variables associated w/ "long" vs "short" shelter duration

# Next steps:
+ drop Name, DateTime, and Found Location for now; keep Animal ID for now?
+ handle Nan 
   + intake group: only 2 rows w/ NaN data -> dropped
   + outcome group: 
       - 1 cat (Animal ID = A890645) w/ NaN Outcome type but Foster subtype -> 
                all other Fosters are Outcome Type = Adoption -> 
                manually changed this cat to Outcome Type Adoption
       - 38 other animals have NaN as Outcome Type -> Lost to follow up? 
            - Would be nice to trace these animals intake and see if there is info about them (common intake date/other info)
            - lost_to_follow_up list created + dropped them from the main dataframe
       - 2 dogs returned to owner (Animal IDs = A830333, A667395) w/ NaN sex 
            - dropped from dataframe
       - 9 pets w/ NaN age assigned "Unknown"
       - all the pets with "NaN" as the subtype were adjusted to have "None" as a subtype
+ "Age Upon Intake" is a string w/ written years vs months 
    - Options: convert to timestamp? calculate DOB?
    - Solution - regex to parse and convert to days as an int
    - could then use the int to get rid of negatives in the module
    - could also convert from days -> months/years, but not necessary for processing (will need to be converted for data visualization
+ investigate negative ages in intake data
    - typos vs other (one -3yo dog described as "aged" condition, so cannot trust abs())
    - few pets w/ this condition, so dropping them all. 
+ Sanity check ages with categories associated w/ age extremes
    + neonate & aged condition needs to be pruned to remove old pets miscategorized as "neonate"
    + 16 "aged" cats with ages between 2 and 1yr
    + no male pregnant animals
    + Nursing has been split between "nursing juvenile" and "nursing adult" 
    + no male nursing adults
    + put nursing sanity check in module
+ are there negative ages in outcome data?
    + yes - the same pets as in the intake data -> dropping them
- Intake Types
- consider grouping "At Vet" with "Disposal" since these animals were never candidates for adoption
- balancing data based on outcome? vs other factor depending on goal
- standardize data?
- Clustering "manually" vs machine learning (one hot encoding vs other ML classification technique)?
- lost to follow-up writing to csv
